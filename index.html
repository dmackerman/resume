### The "Why"?

When most people work with me, one of the comments I get a lot of is "hungry for more". I'm always on the hunt for new technologies, working up (and making up) excuses to play with the latest and greatest. I'm a sucker for client facing work, and would love to get the chance to develop systems that touch lots of individuals. I'm in a great position to bring a lot to the table in terms of work ethic, and a fresh perspective on whatever the project may be.

Find my resume below, and thanks for looking.

Cheers,
Dave

### Work
#### Modus Create - Reston, VA

_Front-End Developer & Lead Designer_
November 2011 - Present

My role at Modus changes daily, but I'd best describe it as a "Senior Engineer, sprinkled with design work". I've work directly with clients in a UX role to gather requirements, as well as wire-framing, designing, and developing great user experiences. It's really quite hard to sum up all of the work I've done at Modus.

- Led a small team in the design and development of [ProductShop](https://productshop.io/) - a platform for scoping, planning, and estimating software. The entire front-end is written with AngularJS, using ES6 and is fully covered by tests. The backend is Rails, some of which I helped architect and engineer.
- Led a small team of Engineers and designers to design and implement a full stack inventory management system. Organized a very large AngularJS codebase into re-usable components that were utilized both on the desktop, as well as in the Ionic hybrid mobile web app. We achieved 74% unit test coverage following a TDD approach.
- Front-end development on a Facebook application called “Mexico Today”, a social magazine reader for the government of Mexico. The app was driven by a Wordpress database, with a CodeIgnitor MVC layer. [Check out the app here](https://www.facebook.com/MexicoToday/app_245627648785326)
- Led a one week engagement to kickstart a mobile product for Saba - an LMS and large scale corporate training company who wanted to break into the social enterprise market. Designed a full suite of visual designs, as well as helped style and implement a working prototype in Sencha Touch in 3 weeks time.
- Worked directly with PBS to set up a mobile presence for their PBS Video Portal. Developed responsive wireframes that will be used to guide development. A deployed version of what I helped design and develop can be seen on [http://video.pbs.org/](http://video.pbs.org/).
- Design and front-end assistance on a business and task management iPhone application for HandySoft. Also assisted in the initial phases of interface design and flow. The app was packaged with Phone Gap (Cordova) and is now [available in the app store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bizflow-mobile/id536290691?mt=8).
- Developed full wireframes and visual designs for a tablet version of The Atlantic Wire - a subsidiary of The Atlantic. The app was built using Sencha Touch, and the majority of the front-end development - themeing, styling, and design, was done by myself. [Check out the app](http://touch.theatlanticwire.com/) on a tablet for an optimal viewing experience.
- Front-end development and visual design assistance on a ExtJS application for Oxford Consulting Services group. The app manages potential hires and matches them with companies that need their services.
- Full design and development of the moduscreate.com website. Built on Wordpress using the Zurb Foundation framework.
- Extremely active in the tech community in regards to Meetups, and contributing to the Open Source community. I actively help Modus in the 3 meetups that we host along the east coast. NovaJS, NYCJS, and ProvidenceJS.
- **Unfortunately, many of the client projects I worked on are under NDA and cannot be mentioned here.**
