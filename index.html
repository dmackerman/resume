            <p>When most people work with me, a popular comment I get is &#8220;hungry for more.&#8221;
                I like to think of myself as a self-starter, a great listener, and a leader when I have to be.
                I&#8217;m always on the hunt for new technologies, finding excuses to play with
                 the latest and greatest - which I feel is a critical personality trait in the front-end industry.  I enjoy client facing work, and would love to
                  get the chance to work on develop systems that touch lots of individuals. I&#8217;m in a great position to
                  bring a lot to the table in terms of work ethic, passion, and a fresh perspective on whatever the project may be.</p>
            <p>Find my resume below, and thanks for looking!</p>
            <p>Cheers,
                <br> <em>Dave</em>

                <p>My primary focus over the past 6 years has been on Front-end web development, design, and all of the associated tools that go with the craft.
